i dont know why it didnt work
1.	Time measure (Tape measure clock)
The idea is to motorize a tape measure and programmed it to move over the course of the day to show the time in hours (inches).
For this they used stepper motor for the tape and control it with arduino coding. The circuit includes the RTC Chip, H-bridge, Motor and limit switch. They have used the buck converter for constant voltage supply to arduino and 12V to stepper motor.  Then they used the 3D printer to print the case and fitted all inside.
The idea of using distance as time is cool as thatâ€™s what relativity is.
