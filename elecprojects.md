2)  __Automated water motor with level indicator__
This project is based on reflection of echo. JSN-SR04 or a Water Proof ultra-sonic sensor is an electronic device that works on the 
principle of transmission and reflection. This sensor has two pins named as TRIG and ECHO pin. The echo pin emits the waves. 
These waves travel through the medium as a wave and reflects back whenever it hits an object or an obstacle ahead of its propagation.
The time taken for the emission and reflection is calculated and using this value they calculated the water level. Thus, Arduino is 
coded accordingly. An LCD screen is used to display the information.

3) __Cell Phone tracking system__
(Using schottky diodes)
__Schottky diodes__ are special diodes formed by combining N type semiconductor material with a metal and are typically low noise diodes,
operating at a high frequency. These diodes have a unique property of conducting at a very low forward voltage between 0.15 to 0.45V.
This enables the diode to provide high switching speed and better system efficiency.  The low noise is due to the very low reverse 
recovery time of about 100 per sec.
__Basic Idea__: The signal from mobile phone is a RF signal. When a mobile phone is present near the circuit, the RF signal from the
mobile induces a voltage in the inductor via mutual induction. This AC signal of high frequency of the order of GHz is rectified by 
the Schottky diode. The output signal is filtered by the capacitor. This low power signal can be amplified and used to power any 
indicator like an LED in this case. The signal is amplified using BJT in its common emitter mode.  i.e. the emitter base junction 
is forward biased and the collector base junction is reverse biased, a small base current results in a larger collector current.

From the block diagram we can easily understand that the message signal or conversation signal received by mic is modulated with the carrier frequency which is generated by the tank circuit. The message signal and carrier signal is modulated by the transistor and transmit the modulated signal in the air through the antenna. The modulated signal is received by the receiver antenna and gives to the FM radio where the user can listen to the conversation. User should adjust the receiver frequency in the radio for receiving the signal from the transmitter.
In this circuit FM modulation is used. The tank circuit (combination of capacitor) which produce the carrier signal for the conversation or message signal, the transistor will amplify the both the signals and send to air through the antenna. Another capacitor is used to filter the signal and cancel the noise. The FM radio receiver set is adjusted to our frequency for listening to the conversation

5) __Bidirectional Visitor Counter Circuit Principle__
The circuit works on the principle of IR sensing. Infrared or simply IR Sensors are devices that work with Infrared Light Source and a Photo Detector like a Photo Diode or a Photo Transistor that act as a Transmitter and Receiver respectively. In this project, they have used an IR LED as the IR Transmitter and a Photo Diode as the IR Receiver. Two sets of IR sensors consisting of an IR LED and Photo Diode are placed at two ends of the entrance of a room. Output from each sensor is fed to the microcontroller. In normal operation, IR light from the LED would not fall on the Photo Diode as it is a Reflective type IR Sensor. The output from the sensor would be a logic LOW signal in this case. In case of any interruption (due to any person crossing the path), the Photo Diode would start receiving the IR Light and start conducting. As a result, the output from the sensor would be a logic HIGH signal. The transition from low to high, for each sensor pair is detected by the microcontroller and accordingly the count would be increased or decreased.

6) __Line following robot__
The circuit consists of 8051 microcontroller, IR Sensors (with IR transmitter and IR Receiver), L298N Motor Driver Module, Robot Chassis with 4 wheels and 4 motors, battery holder. 8051 microcontroller is the main component of the project. It is an 8 bit microcontroller with 32 programmable I/O pins. This has many peripheral features like programmable UART, two 8-bit timer/counter, two interrupts, external memory access etc. The DC motors of the robot are connected to the controller using a motor driver IC. As the output of the controller is maximum 5V with very small current, it cannot drive the motors. So, to amplify this voltage motor driver IC is used. L298N can drive motors up to 36v and can provide a drive current of 3A.The two IR sensors are connected to the microcontroller. Arrange the chassis and connect the four wheels of the robotic vehicle to the motors which are in turn connected to the microcontroller.
IR sensors are designed in a way that when IR transmitter (which is continuously transmitting the rays) is on the black surface these rays were absorbed by the surface and when it is on white surface these rays were reflected. The IR receiver has maximum resistance when no IR rays are received and voltage from VCC flows through the resistor. At the output pin, voltage is approximately 5V.
As the intensity IR rays received by the receiver increases, resistance value decreases and reverse break down occurs. Thus voltage through the resistor is grounded. So, at the output pin, it will produce 0V.

7) __Mobile Controlled Home Appliances__
The main principle used in this circuit is DTMF communication i.e. Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency. If you press the button in your mobile phone, a tone is generated with 2 frequencies. These 2 frequencies of the tone are row and column frequencies of that particular button. These generated tones are decoded at switching center to determine which button is pressed. They used this DTMF tones to control the devices from remote area. To decode these DTMF tones at receiver they used a DTMF decoder. Decoder IC converts these tones into the digital form. 
(The main components in this circuit are DTMF decoder. When we make a call to the mobile which is connected at the receiver end, the MT8870 IC provides high pulse at 15th pin after receiving a valid signal. Now if you press 1 from the mobile the output of the decoder IC at pins Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 will be 1, 0, 0 and 0 respectively.(Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4 is marked on DTMF board)As the Q1 pin is connected to the input of the relay, it will be activated and as a result, the load will be turned ON. To turn off the load, press any number that makes Q1 as 0 i.e. 2 for example.)

8) __Car Parking Guard Circuit Using Infrared Sensor__
The IR sensor will detect the obstacle with in 100cm, if there is any obstacle it will sense and give information to the tone detector which will enable the LM555 timer to generate a PWM for the buzzer. The LM555 will generate the pulse which helps to buzz the buzzer so driver can understand that there is an obstacle.
