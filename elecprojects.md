2)  __Automated water motor with level indicator__
This project is based on reflection of echo. JSN-SR04 or a Water Proof ultra-sonic sensor is an electronic device that works on the 
principle of transmission and reflection. This sensor has two pins named as TRIG and ECHO pin. The echo pin emits the waves. 
These waves travel through the medium as a wave and reflects back whenever it hits an object or an obstacle ahead of its propagation.
The time taken for the emission and reflection is calculated and using this value they calculated the water level. Thus, Arduino is 
coded accordingly. An LCD screen is used to display the information.

3) __Cell Phone tracking system__
(Using schottky diodes)
__Schottky diodes__ are special diodes formed by combining N type semiconductor material with a metal and are typically low noise diodes,
operating at a high frequency. These diodes have a unique property of conducting at a very low forward voltage between 0.15 to 0.45V.
This enables the diode to provide high switching speed and better system efficiency.  The low noise is due to the very low reverse 
recovery time of about 100 per sec.
__Basic Idea__: The signal from mobile phone is a RF signal. When a mobile phone is present near the circuit, the RF signal from the
mobile induces a voltage in the inductor via mutual induction. This AC signal of high frequency of the order of GHz is rectified by 
the Schottky diode. The output signal is filtered by the capacitor. This low power signal can be amplified and used to power any 
indicator like an LED in this case. The signal is amplified using BJT in its common emitter mode.  i.e. the emitter base junction 
is forward biased and the collector base junction is reverse biased, a small base current results in a larger collector current.

4) __FM bugger__

From the block diagram we can easily understand that the message signal or conversation signal received by mic is modulated with the carrier frequency which is generated by the tank circuit. The message signal and carrier signal is modulated by the transistor and transmit the modulated signal in the air through the antenna. The modulated signal is received by the receiver antenna and gives to the FM radio where the user can listen to the conversation. User should adjust the receiver frequency in the radio for receiving the signal from the transmitter.
In this circuit FM modulation is used. The tank circuit (combination of capacitor) which produce the carrier signal for the conversation or message signal, the transistor will amplify the both the signals and send to air through the antenna. Another capacitor is used to filter the signal and cancel the noise. The FM radio receiver set is adjusted to our frequency for listening to the conversation

5) __Bidirectional Visitor Counter Circuit Principle__
The circuit works on the principle of IR sensing. Infrared or simply IR Sensors are devices that work with Infrared Light Source and a Photo Detector like a Photo Diode or a Photo Transistor that act as a Transmitter and Receiver respectively. In this project, they have used an IR LED as the IR Transmitter and a Photo Diode as the IR Receiver. Two sets of IR sensors consisting of an IR LED and Photo Diode are placed at two ends of the entrance of a room. Output from each sensor is fed to the microcontroller. In normal operation, IR light from the LED would not fall on the Photo Diode as it is a Reflective type IR Sensor. The output from the sensor would be a logic LOW signal in this case. In case of any interruption (due to any person crossing the path), the Photo Diode would start receiving the IR Light and start conducting. As a result, the output from the sensor would be a logic HIGH signal. The transition from low to high, for each sensor pair is detected by the microcontroller and accordingly the count would be increased or decreased.

6) __Line following robot__
The circuit consists of 8051 microcontroller, IR Sensors (with IR transmitter and IR Receiver), L298N Motor Driver Module, Robot Chassis with 4 wheels and 4 motors, battery holder. 8051 microcontroller is the main component of the project. It is an 8 bit microcontroller with 32 programmable I/O pins. This has many peripheral features like programmable UART, two 8-bit timer/counter, two interrupts, external memory access etc. The DC motors of the robot are connected to the controller using a motor driver IC. As the output of the controller is maximum 5V with very small current, it cannot drive the motors. So, to amplify this voltage motor driver IC is used. L298N can drive motors up to 36v and can provide a drive current of 3A.The two IR sensors are connected to the microcontroller. Arrange the chassis and connect the four wheels of the robotic vehicle to the motors which are in turn connected to the microcontroller.
IR sensors are designed in a way that when IR transmitter (which is continuously transmitting the rays) is on the black surface these rays were absorbed by the surface and when it is on white surface these rays were reflected. The IR receiver has maximum resistance when no IR rays are received and voltage from VCC flows through the resistor. At the output pin, voltage is approximately 5V.
As the intensity IR rays received by the receiver increases, resistance value decreases and reverse break down occurs. Thus voltage through the resistor is grounded. So, at the output pin, it will produce 0V.

7) __Mobile Controlled Home Appliances__
The main principle used in this circuit is DTMF communication i.e. Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency. If you press the button in your mobile phone, a tone is generated with 2 frequencies. These 2 frequencies of the tone are row and column frequencies of that particular button. These generated tones are decoded at switching center to determine which button is pressed. They used this DTMF tones to control the devices from remote area. To decode these DTMF tones at receiver they used a DTMF decoder. Decoder IC converts these tones into the digital form. 
(The main components in this circuit are DTMF decoder. When we make a call to the mobile which is connected at the receiver end, the MT8870 IC provides high pulse at 15th pin after receiving a valid signal. Now if you press 1 from the mobile the output of the decoder IC at pins Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 will be 1, 0, 0 and 0 respectively.(Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4 is marked on DTMF board)As the Q1 pin is connected to the input of the relay, it will be activated and as a result, the load will be turned ON. To turn off the load, press any number that makes Q1 as 0 i.e. 2 for example.)

8) __Car Parking Guard Circuit Using Infrared Sensor__
The IR sensor will detect the obstacle with in 100cm, if there is any obstacle it will sense and give information to the tone detector which will enable the LM555 timer to generate a PWM for the buzzer. The LM555 will generate the pulse which helps to buzz the buzzer so driver can understand that there is an obstacle.

9) __Rain Water Sensor__
The block diagram of the Rain Alarm Project is shown in the following image. The three main components of the project are the Rain Water Sensor, 555 Timer IC and Buzzer.

When the Rain Water Sensor detects the Rain, it sends a signal to the 555 Timer. The 555 Timer IC, which is configured in its Astable Mode, will then activate the Buzzer.
The Rain Water Sensor used in this project is shown in the image below. It is a simple sensor and it is an easy to use tool for detecting rain. It can act as a simple switch, where the switch is normally open and when there is rain, the switch closes.
Even though Rain Water sensor is the main component in the circuit. We need not to go and buy in the market or online. We can do it ourselves just by taking the piece of Bakelite or Mica board and aluminium wire.
When the rain water sensor is completed, it should get connected to the circuit and voltage should be passed through the wires.
Rain Water Sensor DIYIf there is no rain, the resistance between the contacts will be very high as there will be no conduction between the wires in the sensor.

If there is rain, the water drops will fall on the rain sensor, which will form a conductive path between the wires and it also decreases the resistance between the contacts.
As a result, the wires on the sensor board will conduct and trigger the NE555 timer through the transistors circuitry. Once NE555 is triggered, it will make the output pin high and which will make the buzzer to make alarm.

10) __Alcohol Breathalyzer__
Breathalyzers are very useful devices in estimating the blood alcohol content of drunk drivers. Police officers often use more advanced and sophisticated testers with digital readings and with printer facility that prints results instantly.
In this project, a simple breath alcohol tester is designed which indicates the levels of alcohol through a set of 10 LEDs. The working of the circuit is explained below.
MQ-3 is the main module in the project. It is an alcohol sensor whose conductivity changes according to the concentration of the alcohol.
The output is given to the signal pin (pin 5) of LM3914, which is an analog voltage sensing IC. According to the value at pin 5, the outputs are activated. For voltages between 0 and 5V, the outputs are activated from 1 to 10.
When the concentration of alcohol sensed is very less, the analog value will be slightly greater than 0V and hence only first few LEDs will glow.
When the concentration increases, the number of LEDs turning on also increases. When the concentration of alcohol is at intoxicated level, all the LEDs will be turned on. The sensitivity of the module can be adjusted by the potentiometer.

11) __Automatic Railway Gate Controller__
The two IR sensors are placed at left and right side of the railway gate. The distance between the two IR sensors is dependent on the length of the train. In general we have to consider the longest train in that route.
Now we’ll see how this circuit actually works in real time. In this image, we can see the real time representation of this project.

If the sensor 1 detects the arrival of the train, microcontroller starts the motor with the help of motor driver in order to close the gate.

The gate remains closed as the train passes the crossing.
When the train crosses the gate and reaches second sensor, it detects the train and the microcontroller will open the gate.
