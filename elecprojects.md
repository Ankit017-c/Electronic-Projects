2)  __Automated water motor with level indicator__
This project is based on reflection of echo. JSN-SR04 or a Water Proof ultra-sonic sensor is an electronic device that works on the 
principle of transmission and reflection. This sensor has two pins named as TRIG and ECHO pin. The echo pin emits the waves. 
These waves travel through the medium as a wave and reflects back whenever it hits an object or an obstacle ahead of its propagation.
The time taken for the emission and reflection is calculated and using this value they calculated the water level. Thus, Arduino is 
coded accordingly. An LCD screen is used to display the information.

3) __Cell Phone tracking system__
(Using schottky diodes)
__Schottky diodes__ are special diodes formed by combining N type semiconductor material with a metal and are typically low noise diodes,
operating at a high frequency. These diodes have a unique property of conducting at a very low forward voltage between 0.15 to 0.45V.
This enables the diode to provide high switching speed and better system efficiency.  The low noise is due to the very low reverse 
recovery time of about 100 per sec.
__Basic Idea__: The signal from mobile phone is a RF signal. When a mobile phone is present near the circuit, the RF signal from the
mobile induces a voltage in the inductor via mutual induction. This AC signal of high frequency of the order of GHz is rectified by 
the Schottky diode. The output signal is filtered by the capacitor. This low power signal can be amplified and used to power any 
indicator like an LED in this case. The signal is amplified using BJT in its common emitter mode.  i.e. the emitter base junction 
is forward biased and the collector base junction is reverse biased, a small base current results in a larger collector current.

4) __FM bugger__






![](/images/fm%20bugger.png)

From the block diagram we can easily understand that the message signal or conversation signal received by mic is modulated with the carrier frequency which is generated by the tank circuit. The message signal and carrier signal is modulated by the transistor and transmit the modulated signal in the air through the antenna. The modulated signal is received by the receiver antenna and gives to the FM radio where the user can listen to the conversation. User should adjust the receiver frequency in the radio for receiving the signal from the transmitter.
In this circuit FM modulation is used. The tank circuit (combination of capacitor) which produce the carrier signal for the conversation or message signal, the transistor will amplify the both the signals and send to air through the antenna. Another capacitor is used to filter the signal and cancel the noise. The FM radio receiver set is adjusted to our frequency for listening to the conversation

5) __Bidirectional Visitor Counter Circuit Principle__
The circuit works on the principle of IR sensing. Infrared or simply IR Sensors are devices that work with Infrared Light Source and a Photo Detector like a Photo Diode or a Photo Transistor that act as a Transmitter and Receiver respectively. In this project, they have used an IR LED as the IR Transmitter and a Photo Diode as the IR Receiver. Two sets of IR sensors consisting of an IR LED and Photo Diode are placed at two ends of the entrance of a room. Output from each sensor is fed to the microcontroller. In normal operation, IR light from the LED would not fall on the Photo Diode as it is a Reflective type IR Sensor. The output from the sensor would be a logic LOW signal in this case. In case of any interruption (due to any person crossing the path), the Photo Diode would start receiving the IR Light and start conducting. As a result, the output from the sensor would be a logic HIGH signal. The transition from low to high, for each sensor pair is detected by the microcontroller and accordingly the count would be increased or decreased.

6) __Line following robot__
The circuit consists of 8051 microcontroller, IR Sensors (with IR transmitter and IR Receiver), L298N Motor Driver Module, Robot Chassis with 4 wheels and 4 motors, battery holder. 8051 microcontroller is the main component of the project. It is an 8 bit microcontroller with 32 programmable I/O pins. This has many peripheral features like programmable UART, two 8-bit timer/counter, two interrupts, external memory access etc. The DC motors of the robot are connected to the controller using a motor driver IC. As the output of the controller is maximum 5V with very small current, it cannot drive the motors. So, to amplify this voltage motor driver IC is used. L298N can drive motors up to 36v and can provide a drive current of 3A.The two IR sensors are connected to the microcontroller. Arrange the chassis and connect the four wheels of the robotic vehicle to the motors which are in turn connected to the microcontroller.
IR sensors are designed in a way that when IR transmitter (which is continuously transmitting the rays) is on the black surface these rays were absorbed by the surface and when it is on white surface these rays were reflected. The IR receiver has maximum resistance when no IR rays are received and voltage from VCC flows through the resistor. At the output pin, voltage is approximately 5V.
As the intensity IR rays received by the receiver increases, resistance value decreases and reverse break down occurs. Thus voltage through the resistor is grounded. So, at the output pin, it will produce 0V.

7) __Mobile Controlled Home Appliances__
The main principle used in this circuit is DTMF communication i.e. Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency. If you press the button in your mobile phone, a tone is generated with 2 frequencies. These 2 frequencies of the tone are row and column frequencies of that particular button. These generated tones are decoded at switching center to determine which button is pressed. They used this DTMF tones to control the devices from remote area. To decode these DTMF tones at receiver they used a DTMF decoder. Decoder IC converts these tones into the digital form. 
(The main components in this circuit are DTMF decoder. When we make a call to the mobile which is connected at the receiver end, the MT8870 IC provides high pulse at 15th pin after receiving a valid signal. Now if you press 1 from the mobile the output of the decoder IC at pins Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 will be 1, 0, 0 and 0 respectively.(Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4 is marked on DTMF board)As the Q1 pin is connected to the input of the relay, it will be activated and as a result, the load will be turned ON. To turn off the load, press any number that makes Q1 as 0 i.e. 2 for example.)

8) __Car Parking Guard Circuit Using Infrared Sensor__
The IR sensor will detect the obstacle with in 100cm, if there is any obstacle it will sense and give information to the tone detector which will enable the LM555 timer to generate a PWM for the buzzer. The LM555 will generate the pulse which helps to buzz the buzzer so driver can understand that there is an obstacle.

9) __Rain Water Sensor__
The block diagram of the Rain Alarm Project is shown in the following image. The three main components of the project are the Rain Water Sensor, 555 Timer IC and Buzzer.
Block Diagram of Rain Water Detector
![](https://www.electronicshub.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Block-Diagram-of-Rain-Water-Detector.png)

When the Rain Water Sensor detects the Rain, it sends a signal to the 555 Timer. The 555 Timer IC, which is configured in its Astable Mode, will then activate the Buzzer.
The Rain Water Sensor used in this project is shown in the image below. It is a simple sensor and it is an easy to use tool for detecting rain. It can act as a simple switch, where the switch is normally open and when there is rain, the switch closes.
Even though Rain Water sensor is the main component in the circuit. We need not to go and buy in the market or online. We can do it ourselves just by taking the piece of Bakelite or Mica board and aluminium wire.
When the rain water sensor is completed, it should get connected to the circuit and voltage should be passed through the wires.
Rain Water Sensor DIYIf there is no rain, the resistance between the contacts will be very high as there will be no conduction between the wires in the sensor.
![](https://www.electronicshub.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rain-Water-Sensor-DIY.jpg)
If there is rain, the water drops will fall on the rain sensor, which will form a conductive path between the wires and it also decreases the resistance between the contacts.
As a result, the wires on the sensor board will conduct and trigger the NE555 timer through the transistors circuitry. Once NE555 is triggered, it will make the output pin high and which will make the buzzer to make alarm.

10) __Alcohol Breathalyzer__
Breathalyzers are very useful devices in estimating the blood alcohol content of drunk drivers. Police officers often use more advanced and sophisticated testers with digital readings and with printer facility that prints results instantly.
In this project, a simple breath alcohol tester is designed which indicates the levels of alcohol through a set of 10 LEDs. The working of the circuit is explained below.
MQ-3 is the main module in the project. It is an alcohol sensor whose conductivity changes according to the concentration of the alcohol.
The output is given to the signal pin (pin 5) of LM3914, which is an analog voltage sensing IC. According to the value at pin 5, the outputs are activated. For voltages between 0 and 5V, the outputs are activated from 1 to 10.
When the concentration of alcohol sensed is very less, the analog value will be slightly greater than 0V and hence only first few LEDs will glow.
When the concentration increases, the number of LEDs turning on also increases. When the concentration of alcohol is at intoxicated level, all the LEDs will be turned on. The sensitivity of the module can be adjusted by the potentiometer.

11) __Automatic Railway Gate Controller__
The two IR sensors are placed at left and right side of the railway gate. The distance between the two IR sensors is dependent on the length of the train. In general we have to consider the longest train in that route.
Now we’ll see how this circuit actually works in real time. In this image, we can see the real time representation of this project.


![](https://www.electronicshub.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1.png)

If the sensor 1 detects the arrival of the train, microcontroller starts the motor with the help of motor driver in order to close the gate.

![](https://www.electronicshub.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2.png)

The gate remains closed as the train passes the crossing.
When the train crosses the gate and reaches second sensor, it detects the train and the microcontroller will open the gate.

12)  __Clap-Clap on / Clap-Clap Off switch circuit!__
This circuit employs some very simple and cheap circuitry, and a simple program. It is relatively easy to make a hardware only clap on/off circuit, but I wanted to create a circuit that required two claps to switch on, and two claps to switch off.  The claps must be in quick succession
As you can see from the picture below, we have an electret microphone connected to the ground line, and to one end of a 10k resistor.   The other end of the resistor is tied to the 5v line.  when an audio sound is sensed by the micrpphone, it changes that audio signal into a voltage that emulates the tone picked up.  We can use that noise, but first we have to condition it.  To rid ourselves of the DC component, we AC-couple the signal using a coupling capacitor.  This signal will be extremely small, so we must first amplify it.  We are going to do that using a handy-dandy LM324 quad op-amp IC.  This chip has 4x on-board op-amps.  We are only going to use two of them.

![](https://pic-microcontroller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Schematic-switch-circuit.jpg)
 
The pull-down resistor to the right of the coupling capacitor is necessary for the operation of the non-inverting amplifier stage to work.  In fact, all components in the below diagram are crutial.  The way a non-inverting op-amp works, is it takes two values RA, which is the 1k resistor connected to the (-) input and ground, and RF (100k potentiometer), which is the feedback resistor, which is connected between the (-) input, and the output, and creates a voltage gain factor.  The voltage gain factor (AV) is a multiplier.  Once we determine the AV, we multiply the voltage at the input by the AV, and we have our output voltage.  The 100k pot is used to vary the voltage gain.  This will either increase the sensitivity or decrease the sensitivity of the circuit.  The equation for AV = RF/RA in a non-inverting amplifier circuit.

13) __Wifi robot vehicle__
 A remote control car that can be driven over the internet or with a laptop wirelessly from up to 500m away. It has a live-feed network camera so that it can be driven without line of sight and a horn so that you can honk at people.
They originally used the AVR Butterfly development board. It was working fine until the batteries ran low one time. There is an error in the AVR butterfly bootloader detailed here that corrupts the code and doesn't let you reprogram it unless you load a new bootloader.It took quite a while to debug the problem and quite a bit of time to fix it so I scrapped that control system. I also found the output voltages to be unpredictable because the outputs are also driving the integrated peripherals like the LCD screen.
The 9.6V rail was powered by putting 4 diodes in series with the 7812 12V rail. A diode takes ~0.7V to turn on. By putting 4 in series, we drop ~2.8V across them and now we have 9V for the devices that need less than 12V. After burning the first bunch of transistors I wanted to run the circuit at a lower voltage. The 7812 regulator is only rated for 1A but the motors would drain considerably more than that. Digikey sells a 7.5A 12V regulator for ~$14 which I bought. I attached it to a heat sink because I thought that it may get pretty hot. After quite a bit of use, it doesn't even get warn, so the heat sink was not required.

14) __Bluetooth Wireless Voltage Meter using Wiimote + Pic Chip + AutoIt__
In this peoject we can see how we can send voltage values to our pc using a Pic chip, Wiimote, and Autoit3 scripting language. The process works by wiring a pic chip to the button pads of a wiimote. Then using the pic chips Analog to Digital Converter, we obtain a 10bit binary value. We will then send that value to Autoit in the form of button presses using the wiimote as a data interface.  On the PC side we will use a library I wrote to receive the data from the wiimote. The library is basically just a port to Wiiuse by Michael Laforest set up in a way to make scripting with the wiimote very easy.

15) __Password Based Door Lock System__
The main component in the circuit is 8051 controller. In this project, a 4×4 Matrix Keypad is used to enter the password. The password which is entered is compared with the predefined password.
If the entered password is correct, then the system opens the door by rotating door motor and displays the status of door on LCD. If the password is wrong, then the door is remains closed and displays “PWD is wrong” on LCD.
Once the circuit is powered ON, microcontroller sends commands to the LCD to display “enter password” on LCD.  Now we need to enter the password using the keypad. Once password is entered, it displays 5 stars on LCD to indicate that controller read password successfully.
Now the controller compares the entered password with predefined password. If the password is matched, then the microcontroller makes P0.0 HIGH and P0.1 LOW, so the motor driver gets the input signals for forward motion of the motor.
As a result, the Door Motor rotates in forward direction to open the door. After a delay of 10seconds, the microcontroller makes P0.0 LOW and P0.1 HIGH, so the motor driver gets the input signals for reverse motion. As a result, the Door motor rotates in reverse direction to close the door.
If the password is not matched, then microcontroller maintains both P0.0 and P0.1 LOW. Hence, the door motor is stationary so that door remains closed.

16) __The Multimeter Clock__

![](https://pic-microcontroller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Multimeter-Clock.jpg)


The Multimeter Clock consists of three multimeters, the first meter displays hours, the second displays minutes and the last displays seconds. A 16F628A PIC microcontroller keeps track of time and outputs a calculated current to each meter to display the current time.
Since the clock controller is built onto a perf board you have lots of flexibility on layout. Construct the circuit according to the schematic diagram. The PIC Microcontroller will need to be programmed with the Multimeter Clock firmware using a PIC chip programmer. When powered up the blue LED will give you a visual indication that things are working, during the power up phase the LED will light steady and as soon as the clock is running it will flash on for one second and off for one second.
The firmware was written in PICBasic Pro so you will need that language if you wish to make changes to the existing functionality. There is still about 20% of the 2K PIC code space still available so there is lots of space for some hacking.
The meter faces of the multimeters will need to be updated to show time scales. I used a program called MeterBasic by Tonne Software. To make a new meter face all you need to do is enter the measurements of the meter face, the name for the meter and scale information. In the end you have a perfect matching scale for your meter. 


17) __Hacking the Xbox CONTROLLER__
How they install a PIC microcontroller inside of an Xbox controller in order to provide custom functions.At last,all we have to do is go write some code and program a chip!
Locate and remove the screws.There are seven phillips head screws holding the two halves of the controller together. One of them is hidden underneath the sticker.The easiest way to get to the hidden screw is to feel where it is, then push the screwdriver through.
Now that you have removed and stored all seven screws, remove the BOTTOM half of the controller. If you remove the top, all the buttons will fall out. The bottom should lift off easily.Now, pull up on the plastic bit that holds the headset and other peripherals. It will slide out, along with the pcb. Be mindful of the rumble motors that are still plugged into the pcb. We’ll disconnect these in a later step.Now that you have removed the pcb, store the top half in a safe place, where you won’t lose any buttons. If they do fall out, putting them back is pretty easy. They all have unique shapes, and they can’t be put in the wrong hole.
Now we will remove the communicator/peripheral socket and motors to get better access to the board, itself.
Let’s take the motors off, first. We don’t want the wires to break. The connector is rather like a chinese finger trap. The harder you pull on it, the tighter it gets. The trick to get it out easily is to catch the edge of this ridge with a small screwdriver or a probe/needle of some type.This pesky bit of plastic has four retainer tabs holding it in place. This can be removed easily once you have found them.First notice the white circles? These circles show where the support cylinders on the bottom plastic contact the board. We don’t want any wires to cross these lines.There is room enough to place a small microcontroller here. The trick is to “dead bug” it. This means we are going to place the chip upside down, and affix it to the pcb with hotmelt glue. Notice the proximity to accessible ground and power points, as well as one of the signal traces that I was interested in for this project, namely the trace that carries the signal from the Y button to the main Atmel microcontroller that is the “brain” of this particular controller.
Look carefully for the yellow highligted boxes that show the Y-button and X-button access points. This is the brain of the controller. All of the button inputs eventually end up here. So why don’t we just solder directly to this chip? Well, when you see how small this chip is, you will know. The average hobbyist doesn’t have the ability to solder to things this small. You can see that the pins are labelled at pin 1, 12, 13, 24, 25, 36, and 48. But I digress.
Here’s our dead bug. I chose the pic 12f683. The indentation on the chip is pointing down.The Atmel “brain” runs on 5V, as is common with many other microcontrollers, including our PIC, so we just have to find a good place to commandeer. I chose to take power and ground from the peripheral port. Why don’t I use that closer ground point I highlighted earlier? Well, both points are in continuity, but that’s not the whole story. Capacitance at each point may be different, and I don’t want to take any other components on the board out of their specified operating parameter in this regard, especially the precision pots nearby that provide the R thumstick inputs.
So first, apply a dab of solder to the ground lead.
